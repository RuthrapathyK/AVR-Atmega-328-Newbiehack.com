The projects are created with Atmel Studios(Microchip Studios now).I used Arduino UNO and ATMEGA 328 microcontroller for testing and developing the codes.The following codes are intended for personal learnings.

Customizations for public use will be added in future.

The header files used in the source code are also created for personal learnings and are also included in the project.
